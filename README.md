# Bitcoin Investment Advisor
This is a fun little web app to help prospective buyers decide whether or not Bitcoin is for them.
It's a single-page app, fully responsive, based on the [Photon HTML5 Template](http://html5up.net/photon 'Html5Up')

## Deploying
For Apache users, there's a site conf file and a basic deploy script in the apache/ folder.
No NginX or other conf files at the moment, but this one's pretty trivial to set up. No backend services needed.
